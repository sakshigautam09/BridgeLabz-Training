## Day — January 8, 2026
## Topic: Object-Oriented Design & Linked Lists in C#
## Projects: Smart Home Automation System, Linked List–Based Programs

## What I Learned
    * Applied core OOP concepts in a practical system design
    * Understood how abstraction and polymorphism simplify device control
    * Learned when to use different types of linked lists
    * Improved understanding of pointer and reference handling in C#

## Morning Session: Smart Home Automation System
    * Designed appliance classes such as Light, Fan, and AC
    * Used encapsulation to protect internal device states
    * Implemented interfaces to achieve abstraction
    * Applied inheritance for shared appliance behavior
    * Used polymorphism to allow different device responses
    * Understood the importance of a controller for centralized management

## Afternoon Session: Linked Lists in C#
    * Implemented singly linked lists for basic data storage problems
    * Used doubly linked lists for scenarios requiring backward traversal
    * Implemented circular linked lists for continuous processing system
    * Performed insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal operations
    * Avoided collections to strengthen core data structure concepts

## Key Concepts Applied
    * Encapsulation and data hiding
    * Abstraction using interfaces
    * Inheritance for code reuse
    * Polymorphism for dynamic behavior
    * Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists

## Tasks Completed
    * Built a Smart Home Automation system using OOP
    * Implemented multiple linked list programs in C#
    * Tested logic for different edge cases
    * Maintained structured and readable code
