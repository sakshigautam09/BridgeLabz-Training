## Day — January 21, 2026
## Topic: Collections in C#

## Scenarios Implemented
## List Operations:
    * Reversing a List without built-in methods
    * Rotating elements by given positions
    * Removing duplicates while preserving order
    * Finding the Nth element from the end
    * Counting frequency of elements using Dictionary

## Set Operations:
    * Comparing two sets for equality
    * Finding Union, Intersection, and Symmetric Difference
    * Converting a set to a sorted list without using built-in sort
    * Checking subset relationships

## Map/Dictionary Operations:
    * Counting word frequencies in a text
    * Inverting a Dictionary<K,V> to Dictionary<V,List<K>>

## Key Concepts Applied
    * Generics and type-safe collections (List<T>, HashSet<T>, Dictionary<K,V>)
    * Manual iteration and element manipulation
    * Stability and order preservation in lists
    * Non-comparison based sorting and set operations
    * Modular, scenario-based DSA implementation

## Tasks Completed
    * Implemented all required List, Set, and Map operations manually
    * Reinforced understanding of generics in C#
    * Practiced writing modular and reusable code
    * Tested scenarios to ensure correctness and stability

## Day — January 22, 2026
## Topic: C# Streams & Rank Sheet Generator

## Morning Session: C# Streams
## Scenarios Implemented
    * Reading large files efficiently using StreamReader
    * Writing data to files using StreamWriter
    * Copying files using FileStream and BufferedStream
    * Filtering stream data (uppercase to lowercase conversion)
    * Binary data handling using BinaryReader and BinaryWriter
    * In-memory data processing using MemoryStream
    * Inter-thread communication using PipeStreams
    * Exception-safe stream handling

## Key Concepts Applied
    * Stream-based I/O vs memory-based processing
    * Buffered vs unbuffered streams (performance impact)
    * Text vs binary streams
    * Character encoding handling (UTF-8)
    * Resource management and safe closing of streams
    * Sequential, efficient file processing for large data

## Afternoon Session: Rank Sheet Generator (C# Application)
## Scenarios Implemented
    * Storing student records (roll no, name, marks)
    * Calculating total marks and percentage
    * Generating rank list based on scores
    * Handling tie cases logically
    * Sorting student data manually without built-in sorting helpers
    * Displaying formatted rank sheet in console
    * Writing rank sheet output to a file

## Key Concepts Applied
    * Collections (List<T>, Dictionary<TKey,TValue>)
    * Manual sorting and comparison logic
    * Data aggregation and computation
    * Separation of data processing and display logic
    * Real-world application of collections and streams

## Tasks Completed
    * Implemented multiple stream-based file operations
    * Compared buffered and unbuffered stream performance
    * Built an end-to-end rank sheet generator
    * Reinforced practical usage of collections with streams
    * Practiced writing efficient, readable, and modular C# code
