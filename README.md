## Day — January 21, 2026
## Topic: Collections in C#

## Scenarios Implemented
## List Operations:
    * Reversing a List without built-in methods
    * Rotating elements by given positions
    * Removing duplicates while preserving order
    * Finding the Nth element from the end
    * Counting frequency of elements using Dictionary

## Set Operations:
    * Comparing two sets for equality
    * Finding Union, Intersection, and Symmetric Difference
    * Converting a set to a sorted list without using built-in sort
    * Checking subset relationships

## Map/Dictionary Operations:
    * Counting word frequencies in a text
    * Inverting a Dictionary<K,V> to Dictionary<V,List<K>>

## Key Concepts Applied
    * Generics and type-safe collections (List<T>, HashSet<T>, Dictionary<K,V>)
    * Manual iteration and element manipulation
    * Stability and order preservation in lists
    * Non-comparison based sorting and set operations
    * Modular, scenario-based DSA implementation

## Tasks Completed
    * Implemented all required List, Set, and Map operations manually
    * Reinforced understanding of generics in C#
    * Practiced writing modular and reusable code
    * Tested scenarios to ensure correctness and stability
