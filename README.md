# Day — December 31, 2025 — Scenario-Based Programming in C#
## Topic: Utility Class – Math Operations

## What I Learned
    * Understanding the concept of Utility Classes in C#
    * Learning why utility classes mainly use static methods
    * Designing real-world math operation scenarios
    * Separating logic from execution using utility classes
    * Implementing common mathematical operations using static methods
    * Avoiding object creation for reusable logic
    * Designing a menu-driven Math Utility Application

## Implementing operations like:
    * Addition
    * Subtraction
    * Multiplication
    * Division (with divide-by-zero handling)
    * Modulus
    * Power calculation
    * Factorial calculation
    * Using switch-case for menu selection
    * Applying while loop for continuous execution
    * Validating user input to prevent runtime errors
    * Improving logical flow and decision-making
    * Writing clean, modular, and reusable code
    * Refining code readability and structure

## Key Concepts Applied:
    * Utility classes
    * Static methods
    * Menu-driven programming
    * Scenario-based application design
    * Switch-case statements
    * Loops (while)
    * Conditional statements (if-else)
    * Modular programming using methods
    * Input validation and error handling
    * Logical problem-solving

## Task for the Day:
    * Build a scenario-based Math Utility Application
    * Implement reusable static methods
    * Practice menu-driven program structure
    * Strengthen logic-building skills
    * Debug and refine the code
    * Improve code readability and modularity
    * Push Utility Math Operations project to GitHub

    * Using menu-driven programming with while loop
    * Applying switch-case for user interaction
    * Handling invalid input and insufficient balance cases
    * Writing modular methods for banking operations
    * Improving logical thinking through real-world simulations

## Afternoon Session:
    * Designing a Cafeteria Menu Application
    * Storing fixed menu items using string arrays
    * Displaying menu with index-based selection
    * Allowing users to place orders using menu indices
    * Calculating total bill amount

## Implementing reusable methods like:
    * DisplayMenu()
    * GetItemByIndex()
    * CalculateBill()
    * Using loops to handle multiple orders
    * Validating user input to avoid incorrect selections
    * Improving code structure and readability

## Key Concepts Applied:
    * Menu-driven programming
    * Scenario-based application design
    * Arrays (single-dimensional)
    * Loops (for, while)
    * Conditional statements (if-else, switch)
    * Modular programming using methods
    * Input validation and error handling
    * Logical problem-solving

## Task for the Day:
    * Build a Bank Account Management System
    * Implement secure and logical banking operations
    * Create a Cafeteria Menu App with bill calculation
    * Practice real-world scenario-based programming
    * Debug and refine both applications
    * Improve code readability and structure
    * Push both projects to GitHub
